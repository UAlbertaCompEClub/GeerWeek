Script:

::Scene 1::
--- EXT. FOREST - DAYTIME ---

A guy in a deer suit is amongst the trees, grazing. The guy pulls some grass out of the ground and nibbles on it. The guy stops, his head shoots up, and he stands still. After a brief moment, he goes back to nibbling.

KATNISS is behind a tree, watching the guy in a deer suit. She has an arrow ready in her bow. She quietly raises her bow and draws. 

Just as she releases, the guy in a deer suit raises his head. The arrow hits him. Stunned, he tries to run, but immediately falls over. He lays on the ground struggling.

KATNISS approaches the guy in a deer suit and draws a knife. She slits his throat and a ton of blood starts flowing.

She begins cutting as the camera pans away from her - have it show how pretty the trees are while there are bloody/gushy noises.


--- EXT. EDGE OF GOOGLE+ DISTRICT - DAYTIME ---

KATNISS is walking out of the forest into her village, dragging the dead guy in a deer suit by the foot

--- INT. KATNISS’ HOME ---

PRIM is sitting on the couch, playing with her dolls. Their house looks poor. KATNISS enters the house with the guy in a deer suit dangling over her shoulder. She walks towards the table to throw the dead guy in a deer suit down.

PRIM, happy to see her sister, gets up and goes over to her.

PRIM
(happy)
Katniss, you’re back! That sure looks like some big, tasty meat. I can’t wait to put it all in my mouth.
KATNISS 
(sad)
Prim. Little Sister. You remember what today is?

PRIM stops grinning and looks sad as well.

PRIM
(sad)
I was trying not to think about it.

KATNISS puts her arm around her little sister. PRIM hides her head in her sister’s hug. They both look sad. It’s a sad moment. They both get teary.

KATNISS opens her arms and lets her sister go.

KATNISS
Is Mom alright?

PRIM
(shakes her head)
She’s in her room. She hasn’t spoken yet.

KATNISS nods sadly, looking down to the guy in a deer suit.

--- END SCENE ---






::Scene 2::

--- EXT. MAIN SQUARE ---

A crowd of people have gathered around the main square of the district. There is an empty stage in front of them. Google+ logos are around the square.  Guards in clean uniforms are standing guard around the crowd. The crowd is divided by gender, with a division in the middle. They are all somber and quiet.

KATNISS and PRIM enter the square, hand in hand.

PEETA is already in the group on the male’s side. He looks back and sees KATNISS. He stares but says nothing.

KATNISS guides her sister to the girls’ side of the square. She stands tall while PRIM is looking to the ground, trying to seem small and not making eye contact with anyone.

PRIM
(scared)
What if I’m chosen?

KATNISS
(nervous)
You won’t be.

PRIM
But we are all entered. What if my name is drawn?

KATNISS
Don’t be scared, Prim. You’re only entered once. You won’t be a tribute, I promise. Now, go join the other girls.

PRIM nods, tears in her eyes. She turns and walks over to other girls in her age group.

ANNOUNCER enters the square and walks onto the stage. She is followed by WOODY HARRELSON and two guards. Computer/projector screens around the square show that the event is being recorded. Everyone turns their attention to the ANNOUNCER.


ANNOUNCER
(cheerful)
Hello, hello, hello! Hello, Google Plus District - and [looks into camera, addressing the world] Hello world! 

ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
Welcome to the 74th HunGeer Games! Every year, the eleven districts provide two tributes each - one boy and one girl - to compete in the arena. The arena is a battle to the death - and the winner will bathe in glory and riches with a brand new iPad! And remember that there can be only one victor. No loopholes. All youth between twelve and eighteen must enter the poll at least once each year, along with any polisci majors.

ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
Now, for the draw! May the odds be ever in your favour. We will start with the girls. May the odds be ever in your flavour.

ANNOUNCER walks over to a bowl that is filled with tickets. ANNOUNCER puts a hand in the bowl, skimming her fingers through the tickets playfully. ANNOUNCER pinches a ticket between her fingers and pulls it out.

ANNOUNCER
(cheerful)
Prim Everdeen! Is Prim Everdeen here? Prim?

The crowd turns to look at PRIM. PRIM stands still, dazed. She has a terrified look on her face. She slowly takes a step forward, walking towards the stage. PRIM looks behind her to try and find KATNISS.

KATNISS is stunned. She stares at her sister in disbelief.

PRIM starts to cry as guards escort her to the stage. KATNISS shapes her head furiously. She runs forward.

KATNISS
(Crying, hopeless)
No, Prim! No!

PRIM
Katniss!

As KATNISS runs to the stage, two guards grab her by the arms to try and hold her back.

 KATNISS (CONT’D)
Stop! I volunteer!

The guards let go of KATNISS. She stands tall, addressing the ANNOUNCER.

KATNISS (CONT’D)
I volunteer! I volunteer as tribute.

ANNOUNCER
(happy)
Amazing, a volunteer! 

KATNISS walks up to the stage. PRIM is lead back to the crowd by guards.

ANNOUNCER
What’s your name, child?

KATNISS
Katniss Everdeen.

ANNOUNCER
Everyone, Catpiss Everdeen. Volunteer tribute for the Google Plus district! 

KATNISS
No, it’s KatNiss--

ANNOUNCER
(whisper to KATNISS)
Shut up, don’t care.

ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
(happy)
And now, for the male tribute.

ANNOUNCER walks over to a second bowl of tickets and pulls out a new one. She unfolds it.

ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
Peeta Mellark!

PEETA stands tall, staring forwards. He has a look of disbelief, then acceptance. The crowd stares at him. He steps forward, walking to the stage.

ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
And there you have it. The Google Plus district tributes for the 74th Annual HunGeer Games - Peeta Mellark and Cat-Urine Everdeen!


--- END SCENE ---

::Scene 3::



--- INT. MAKEUP ROOM ---

The tributes are all together having their makeup done. Some extras are going around to each of the tributes to help them. 

KATNISS is having her makeup done. PEETA is sitting there with her.


PEETA
Katniss, I just wanted to say.. What you did for your sister, it was really.. you know..

KATNISS
Thanks Peeta.

PEETA
Did you get to see Prim before you left?

KATNISS
No.. they said I couldn’t see her.. What about you? Did you get to see your parents?

PEETA
I.. I don’t have any parents.

KATNISS
Oh.. your friends at the orphanage?

PEETA
[shakes head]
No.. no friends.

KATNISS
A stray cat with three legs that you sleep with?

PEETA shakes his head.

WOODY comes in and sits next to them.

WOODY
Hey there, kiddos.

KATNISS
You’re Woody Harrelson, aren’t you? The Google Plus victor from a few years ago. Aren’t you supposed to be training us?

WOODY
Yeah, that’s the idea. I get to ‘impart you my wisdom’ or what not. I’d rather have done a horror flick, but I guess we have to work with this shit theme.


An extra comes up to PEETA. The extra motions for PEETA to follow them. He follows them out into another room.


--- INT. WAXING ROOM ---

In the other room, two extras beckon for PEETA to sit in a chair. They remove his shirt, and begin shaving his chest hair.

--- INT. MAKEUP ROOM ---

KATNISS is looking around at the tributes.

KATNISS
Are these the other tributes?

WOODY
Yeah, they are. You have to be careful around them, Katniss. They all want to win. And they’ll do all they can to kill you.


KATNISS looks around the room and her eyes stop on CATO. He is being massaged by a bunch of girls, and having abs drawn on his stomach.

KATNISS
Who’s that?

WOODY
That’s Cato. He’s the male tribute from the Facebook district. Worth remembering. The one drawing the abs is Clove, she’ll probably be killed off.

WOODY looks around the room.

WOODY
Pretty sure everyone else gets killed. Fuck we have a lot of extras.

--- INT. WAXING ROOM ---

The EXTRAS have finished shaving PEETA. He’s lying back with his eyes closed, content. The extras begin applying the wax strips onto his chest. PEETA’s eyes shoot open and he begins struggling.

PEETA
Nononononono.. What are you doing?

The extras hold him down and pull off a strip. PEETA screams.


--- INT. MAKEUP ROOM ---

KATNISS and WOODY hear the scream, and look over at the doorway. Around a corner, RUE pokes her head out, looking at KATNISS.

KATNISS
(startled)
Prim? Prim, what are you-

KATNISS makes a motion to move towards RUE. WOODY grabs KATNISS’ arm, holding her back. RUE runs off.

WOODY
No, Katniss. Her name is Rue, tribute from the Twitter district. 

KATNISS
Oh.. She.. She looks just like Prim..

WOODY
You can tell them apart by the change of wig. Never trust small girls, they say they’re willing and then afterwards they go tell their parents and.. Just stay away from her.

WOODY
Now listen. You’ll be out in the arena soon and you have to be careful. Don’t trust the other tributes, and don’t trust the arena itself. Those running the Games want a good show, so they’ll do all they can to make it entertaining. 

KATNISS
I understand.

WOODY
Speaking of dangers, be wary of..

WOODY motions back at the doorway PEETA left through.

KATNISS
Who? Peeta? No.. he wouldn’t..

WOODY
Katniss, there can only be one victor. You can’t trust Peeta. He may seem weak and useless, but he’s a lot stronger than you think.

--- INT. WAXING ROOM ---

Jump to successive shots of PEETA having his chest waxed. Have him cry and yell a lot.

--- INT. MAKEUP ROOM ---

WOODY and KATNISS are staring at the doorway the screams came from.

KATNISS
Shouldn’t you be coaching him as well?

WOODY
Nah, I doubt he makes it through the first scene. The Games start in an hour. Fuck the odds.


--- END SCENE ---






:Scene 4::
---EXT. CLEARING - DAYTIME ---

Commercial is on for TSN 8 - the Ocho. ANNOUNCER is talking over some cool CG commercial. For parts of the commercial, show the districts watching the HunGeer games on monitors. We could have a fake-monitor/green-screen set up in quad to get shots of crowds. We could also have people watching in their homes.

ANNOUNCER
Edmonton Alberta. A city built on frozen ice, broken dreams, and cold handjobs. A city where you can get a happy ending, if you pay a little extra. A city home to a sports movie greater than the Grey Cup, the Stanley Cup, and the War of 1812 combined. Pre-recorded from Edmonton, it’s the Edmonton Hungeer Games here on TSN 8 - “The Ocho”.


The commercial is over and the starting arena is shown.


ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
There’s an electricity in the air, a palpable hue of anticipation. The tributes are ready to enter the arena. They’ll be teleported in and the first countdown will commence and -- Oh, and now they’re arriving.


Tributes are teleported in, using StarTrek CG and sounds. They are all standing on pedestals, waiting. KATNISS is looking around at the arena. It is a clearing with trees around. The other tributes are on the pedestals around her, looking around as well. CATO has his eyes focused straight ahead on the bags, looking all badass.

KATNISS sees a bow amidst the bags. She then makes eye contact with PEETA, who sees the bow as well and shakes his head. KATNISS glues her eyes forwards back on the bow.


As the ANNOUNCER counts down, everyone gets all tense and shit. Camera goes between all the tributes, showing off their costumes and building tension.


ANNOUNCER
5… 4... 3... 2... 1... VAMANOS!


Huge bloodbath comes next. Here’s what happens next in unnecessarily shaky cam:
Twitter M		Dead
Twitter F (Rue)	Runs for Trees
MySpace M		Gets pack, survives
MySpace F		Dead
Reddit M		Pack, joins antagonist
Reddit F		Gets pack, survives
4chan M #1		Killed by 4chan M #2
4chan M #2		Killed by 4chan M #1
LinkedIn M		Gets pack, t
LinkedIn F		Dead
Tumblr M		Dead (room for Yahoo! joke?)
Tumblr F		Dead
Instagram M		Dead
Instagram F		Pack, survives
Pinterest F1		Pack, joins antagonist
Pinterest F2		Pack, joins antagonist
OKCupid F		Dead
OKCupid M		Pack, joins antagonist

For those joining antagonist, ensure they don’t attack each other. They kill / attack those that are going for packs.


PEETA runs to the trees.

KATNISS runs to try and get the bag with the bow. As she runs, she dodges attacks, trying desperately to stay alive. Around her, people are running, screaming, and killing each other. Just as KATNISS is about to reach the bag, MySpace F hits her hard in the side and she falls. KATNISS turns to confront MySpace F, but MySpace F is run through by a downvote thrown by Reddit M.

KATNISS turns and runs for the trees, leaving the bow behind. She manages to grab a pack on the outskirts as she runs.

The camera shows more fighting as KATNISS leaves the scene.
--- END SCENE ---


::Scene 5::
---EXT. FOREST - DAY (Hawrelak Park?)---

KATNISS is running through the forest and exhausted. She is out of breath. She stops to catch her breath.

KATNISS’ phone vibrates. She pulls it out and unlocks it. Google+ is open, with a list of the deceased districts.

KATNISS
4chan, Tumblr, LinkedIn girl… [happy] Peeta’s still alive..

KATNISS puts her phone away and looks around the forest. 

KATNISS listens, something doesn’t seem right. She frowns, trying to figure out what is bothering her.

Gradually, she starts to hear music. It is very quiet at first but slowly gets louder. The song is I Knew You Were Trouble by Taylor Swift.

KATNISS looks around and then manages to figure out the direction it’s coming from. It is coming from over a small rise.

The music slowly gets louder as it approaches the chorus. KATNISS takes a few steps toward the sound. 

Right before the chorus, the music gets very loud. LinkedIn M runs out from over the rise.

LinkedIn M
(Terrified, yelling to Katniss)
RUN! GET AWAY FROM THE MUSIC!

Behind LinkedIn M, MySpace M and Reddit F are running away from the music as fast as they can.

KATNISS turns and runs.

Right before the “Lying on the cold hard ground” part of the song, Reddit F (who is the furthest behind them) begins bleeding from her ears, nose, and eyes.

Right after the “Ohhh” and sound drop, Reddit F suddenly blows up.

After the “Trouble trouble trouble” part, the same thing happens to MySpace M with the same timing.

KATNISS continues running, but she veers off away from LinkedIn M. The music gets quieter and KATNISS slows to a walk. She can still hear the music, but it’s quiet. 

KATNISS’ phone vibrates. She pulls it out to see the death of MySpace M and Reddit F. The music in the distance gets to the chorus and she hears a scream. LinkedIn M’s death pops up on Google+.
--- END SCENE ---




::Scene 6::

--EXT. FOREST - DAY---

Instagram F is walking through the forest, taking pictures of the trees. She passes around a fallen tree and sees a plate of food sitting on a stump. It looks really fancy (white plate) and has a bottle of Sriracha next to it. 

Instagram F runs up to the plate of food and starts taking a bunch of pictures of it. CATO steps out of the bushes behind her all sneaky-like, with a giant ‘Like fist’ weapon in hand.

CATO
(whispers to girl)
You should’ve accepted my friend request.

Instagram F turns around, scared shitless. The rest of the antagonists emerge from the trees around them, smirking. This includes CLOVE, Reddit M, Pinterest F1, Pinterest F2, OKCupid F. Lastly, PEETA steps out from behind a tree as well, working with the antagonists.

PEETA is not smirking, but looks sad.


---EXT. FOREST - DAY---

 KATNISS is in a tree, digging through the bag she had found. She pulls out random items from the bag. The last item she pulls out is the giant blue dildo.

Instagram F screams nearby. KATNISS’ looks around the forest, panicking. She puts the dildo back in the bag.

KATNISS hears voices approaching. It is CATO and his gang. They are laughing and talking about their recent kill. 

The antagonists emerge from some bushes and pass right under KATNISS’ tree. She watches quietly. She sees that OKCupid F is carrying a bow.

CATO is leading the way. PEETA isn’t talking, but following behind them, depressed. He’s still hidden behind the trees though.

KATNISS’ phone suddenly starts vibrating. She clutches at it, panicking. Luckily, everyone else’s phones vibrate as well and they don’t notice.

CATO pulls out his phone and unlocks it. He has Facebook open.


CATO
Haha, looks like the blood loss finally got her. Bitch posted her last status.


The antagonists laugh. They start walking again.


CATO (CONT’D)
‘Ey! Google boy, hurry up!


PEETA emerges from the bushes having fallen behind. KATNISS is shocked to see him.

KATNISS
(yells in hushed tone)
PEETA!

KATNISS immediately covers her mouth. CATO looks up at the tree-line, frowning. PEETA follows where CATO is looking.

CATO stops looking around and looks back at PEETA.

CATO
Where’s your little girlfriend? How do I know you’re not tricking us?

PEETA
Back there was one of her snares. We’re in the right direction, I promise.


CATO pushes him forwards. PEETA stumbles and continues walking. Once PEETA is out of sight, CLOVE goes up to CATO.

CLOVE
You aren’t trusting him, are you?

CATO
We need him to get Katniss. Once we have her, we don’t need Peeta. I’ll unfriend him myself.

KATNISS
(whisper)
No.. Cato..

KATNISS moves her position, and her bag (which was still open) tilts over. The big blue dildo falls out of the bag.

We can have a slowmo as KATNISS reaches for the big blue dildo. It falls slowly to the ground.

The big blue dildo hits the ground. CATO turns around to look at the dildo, and then up the tree to see KATNISS.

CATO
THERE’S THE CIRCLE BITCH!

The rest of the antagonists return to the tree.

CATO
You’ve got nowhere to run, Katniss!

OKCUPID F shoots at KATNISS with her bow but misses. CATO looks at OKCUPID, annoyed. He takes her bow and draws.

PEETA
No, wait! Just leave her there, she’ll have to come down for food eventually.

CATO looks at PEETA, annoyed. But then he lowers the bow and nods.

CATO
Alright, fine. Someone get a pile of sticks.

PEETA disappears into the trees. KATNISS ties herself to the branch. She looks sad.

--- END SCENE ---



:Scene 7::
---EXT. FOREST - DUSK---

KATNISS is up in her tree. The others are at the base of the tree, sitting around a pile of sticks. CATO comes in from the bush.

CATO
Hey, where’s Peeta?

The tributes look around, confused. PEETA is nowhere to be seen.

CATO
Shit.. Okay, Pinterest chick! No, the other one. You come with me. The rest of you watch Katniss. 

CATO and Pinterest F2 leave to chase after PEETA. Reddit M, Pinterest F1, OKCupid, and CLOVE are left to watch Katniss.

KATNISS hears a tweet. She looks around and sees RUE hiding in a bush, watching her. KATNISS makes eye contact with her, trying to figure out what she’s doing.

RUE points at a branch. KATNISS looks up and sees a box dangling from a branch. Katniss reaches out and grabs the box.

KATNISS cracks the lid open and pulls a pistol out of the box. She holds it between her fingers, examines it, then shrugs and throws it away.

KATNISS reaches into the box and pulls out a picture. We don’t show the picture to the camera, but KATNISS grins (she has a plan)

KATNISS drops the box to the ground. The tributes stir and notice the box. Pinterest F1 opens the box and takes out the pictures. The pictures are of kittens.

Pinterest F1
OH. MY. GOD. These kittens are so cute!


The rest of them go to look.


Reddit M
They’re adorable! I can’t wait to post these on the wrong subreddits!

CLOVE
Ha! For what, your stupid reddit karma? I’m posting these on my wall, I’ll get so many likes.

Pinterest F1
I found them! They’re getting pinned on my board first.

OKCupid F
WELL I’M LONELY!

A fight scene ensues, which results in everyone dying.


After the battle, KATNISS slowly descends from the tree. She looks to the bush where she saw RUE before, but then sees OKCupid F’s bow. She grabs the bow and then turns to see RUE emerging from the bush.

KATNISS
Hey, you’re Rue, right? Thanks. Your tweet really saved my skin.

RUE
I saw what you.. what you did for your sister. I thought by blowing hard, I could save you. I hoped you wouldn’t.. you know..

KATNISS
Rue, I won’t hurt you. You hungry?

RUE
I could swallow some stiff jerky.

KATNISS
Alright, we should probably get out of here first. Grab my hand, let’s go.



	--EXT. FOREST - DUSK---

Same location. CATO and Pinterest F2 return.

CATO
(talk as he emerges to bushes, he thinks group is still there)
That fucker managed to get away, we’ll look in the...


CATO looks around at the bodies and gets pissed off. Without turning, he yells:


CATO
FIND THAT BITCH!


Pinterest F2 gives CATO a frightened look and then runs off. CATO goes up to CLOVE and kneels over her body, sad. All the phones vibrate, but he ignores them.

Reddit M’s phone vibrates a second time though. CATO frowns and goes to the body. He pulls out Reddit M’s phone and unlocks it.

The Reddit App is open on his phone with a bunch of posts. The posts are mostly the tributes deaths, except for the top post (titled “Just driving around when I found this!”). CATO clicks the post and a treasure map appears, with the pirate bay logo in the bottom right corner.

CATO looks around to orient himself, and then follows the map.

--- END SCENE ---



::Scene 8::
---EXT. FOREST - DAY ---

KATNISS and RUE are walking through the forest together. KATNISS has the bow in hand. RUE is holding a sharp stick.


KATNISS
Alright, we should probably split up to set the snares. We’ll meet back here in an hour, alright?

RUE nods. KATNISS walks in the opposite direction.


--- LATER ---

KATNISS is tracking a deer, she kneels down to touch its tracks. She looks up and starts walking forward.

KATNISS suddenly hears RUE screaming.

KATNISS turns to the scream and starts running.

--- LATER ---

KATNISS comes out of the trees and sees RUE trapped in a net. 

RUE is screaming out KATNISS’ name.

KATNISS
Rue! I’m here, you’ll be alright Rue.

KATNISS runs up to RUE and starts to cut the net.

KATNISS
You’ll be okay, I promise!


RUE
KATNISS! BEHIND YOU.

KATNISS turns around to see Pinterest F2 emerging from the trees, thumbtacks in hand.

KATNISS jumps to the side as Pinterest F2 throws the thumbtacks. KATNISS brings up her bow and shoots. Pinterest falls over dead.

KATNISS lets out her breath slowly, looking down at the body. She turns around, to see RUE laying on her back in the net, breathing heavily.

KATNISS drops her bow and runs up to RUE. RUE has thumbtacks sticking out of her.


KATNISS
No! Rue.. Rue, please no.

KATNISS’ phone vibrates from Pinterest’s death. She ignores it.

RUE
Katniss, oh Lawd. I’m sorry.


KATNISS
(Crying)
Don’t you die on me, Rue. Don’t you do it!


RUE
… Katniss, it’s over for me.. but for you..


KATNISS
No. Don’t say that.. You can’t go.. please..


RUE
.. Katniss. Remember your sister. Remember Prim.


KATNISS
Rue.. No.. You’re only twelve..

RUE
Remember.. remember that.. Everything that has a beginning has an end, Katniss.


RUE dies. KATNISS stays kneeling by her body, crying. Her phone vibrates. 

KATNISS tears turn from sadness to anger. She brushes the tears away with the back of her sleeve.

KATNISS stands, and looks away. She looks back down to RUE’s body once more, and then up to the sky.

KATNISS raises her arm and flips her middle finger to the sky.


---

Show a bunch of clips of crowds watching Hunger Games and fingering the sky as well. Make it seem hopeful. Sad. Revengeful.

--- END SCENE ---






::Scene 9::
--- EXT. FOREST - DAY ---

KATNISS is walking through the forest, sad. 

Suddenly, the ANNOUNCER’s voice thunders over the area:

ANNOUNCER
Attention Tributes. In the interest of favouritism, a new rule has been added. Tributes from the same district can now both win the Hungeer Games. Also, there’s something everyone needs waiting for you all in the clearing. It’s not a trap. May the odds be ever your saviour.

KATNISS grins and starts running through the forest.

KATNISS
(Gleeful, yelling)
Peeta! Peeta!

PEETA
(In the distance, happy as well) 
KATNISS!


They come across each other in the woods. They run to each other and embrace.


PEETA
I’m happy to see you. I thought I’d have been dead by now. Or at least injured.

KATNISS
Yeah, I’m kind of surprised. I thought I’d find you all bloody and we would have a gushy lover fling in a cave or something.

PEETA
Hah! Could you imagine that? Fuck romance.

KATNISS
Yeah! Fuck love scenes.

PEETA
Haha. Alright, we heading to the clearing then?

KATNISS
You don’t think it’s a trap?

PEETA
Of course not. They said it wasn’t. 

KATNISS
Seems legit.


They begin walking towards the clearing. PEETA pulls some berries out of his pocket.

PEETA
You want some berries?

KATNISS 
(nodding, then shocked)
Peeta! Those are poisonous!

PEETA
Oh shit. Good thing you knew that. Imagine if we both ate these and died. Ha! What a shitty way to end the HunGeer Games, amirite?

KATNISS
Yeah, let’s get going. It’s just Cato and us, you know.

PEETA
I was aware of that. Wonder what he’s up to.

---

CATO reaches the destination on the Reddit map. He’s standing in front of a building / shack / whatever-is-available. He puts the phone back in his pocket.


---INT. RANDOM ROOM---

CATO enters the room and looks around. It is empty except for a single computer and a printer. He moves the mouse and the computer wakes. The screen is all white except for a smiley face. 

CATO touches the screen with a finger and the printer begins printing something. CATO grabs the first sheet that’s been printed and reads it. It says the following:
“HunGeer Games
Computer Engineering Club 2014
Geer Week ScreenPlay”

CATO grins and starts reading the screenplay. However, he starts to hear music. It’s the Taylor Swift song again. He turns around in horror.

--- END SCENE ---



::Scene 10::
--- EXT. CLEARING - DAY ---

KATNISS and PEETA arrive at the clearing, but it’s empty. They look around but they don’t see anything.

PEETA
I don’t get it. I thought there was something we needed here.

KATNISS
I don’t know. Something feels wrong.


Their phones both vibrate and they pull them out. The message says that CATO has died.

PEETA
What? Did you see this - Cato is..

KATNISS
Dead.. but does that mean we’ve.. 

PEETA
We won! It’s over! We can leave. I was expecting something more climactic though.

ANNOUNCER
Attention tributes. There has been a new amendment. The previous rule where there could be two winners has been removed. There can be only one. May the odds be ever in your raver.


PEETA and KATNISS stare at each other.

PEETA
Do it.

KATNISS
What?

PEETA
Kill me. You have your sister to go back to. I don’t even have a backstory. You should win. You deserve to win.

KATNISS
No! I can’t do that.

PEETA
You have no choice. They won’t let us both go. You should survive. You should win.

KATNISS
No.. I can’t just.. Wait.. The berries. You still have the berries? Give me half.

PEETA
No, I can’t let you --

KATNISS
We live together... or we die together.

PEETA pulls out the berries. He hands half of them to KATNISS.

They hold hands and have berries in the other hand. They stand side by side, backs to the forest. They take a loving look at each other.

KATNISS
On three.

PEETA
One

KATNISS
Two

KATNISS & PEETA (TOGETHER)
Three

They raise the berries to their mouths. 



PEETA’s head suddenly blows off.

KATNISS is terrified and jumps back. PEETA’s corpse falls to the ground. CATO is standing behind them, smoking shotgun in hand. He is covered in scratches and blood.

KATNISS
You.. you were dead!

CATO
No.. I was supposed to be, but that’s the thing about an off-screen death. You can never be sure, can you?

KATNISS
What are you talking about?

CATO
Not you, Katniss. No, not you. You’ll die, on screen, for the world to see. I’ll be the victor, and become the biggest hit on Facebook since George Takei.


[KATNISS jumps to the side as he fires again. There’s a big fight scene.]
[Eventually, KATNISS is lying on the ground, alive but injured. CATO is out of ammo. He stands over top of her].

CATO
(about to kill Katniss, but stops)
Wait, I’ve seen this.. This is it! This is the end. Yes, you were laying right there, just like that, and I... I... I stand here, right here, I’m... I’m supposed to say something. I say.. Everything that has a beginning has an end, Katniss.

[KATNISS begins to get up again]

CATO
What? What did I just say? No.. No, this isn’t right, this isn’t what happens. Get away from me!

KATNISS
You were right, Cato. You were always right. It was inevitable.


[CATO tries to stab KATNISS with his open hand (like in the Matrix). KATNISS slaps his arm to the side and throws him away from her in a continuous movement. He trips and falls to the ground]

[CATO is furious. He gets up and turns towards KATNISS . But, KATNISS has her bow ready with two arrows drawn]

[CATO only has a moment before KATNISS releases. The arrows pierce him through the eyes. He screams, blood pouring down his face. He falls down to the ground. KATNISS walks up and kicks him over, onto his back. She holds him down by placing her foot on his chest.

CATO
Ahh! What the fuck! This wasn't in the script!

KATNISS
Fuck the script.

[KATNISS performs the death blow. She stumbles away from the body. She falls to her knees, weary]

KATNISS
And fuck denouement.
