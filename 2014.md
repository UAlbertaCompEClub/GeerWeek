Geer Week 2014
----

Geer Week 2014 was a great year, with [Jacob's blog](http://www.ualberta.ca/~jortt/GeerWeek/),
the [HunGeer Games](http://vimeo.com/84193709), and Katniss and the Tributes
(consisting of Sydney Bitner, Mike Blouin, Mavis Chan, Andrew Fontaine, and AJ
Sharpe). None of the club's assests were captured; however, we managed to
capture the Engineering Physics Club flag late Thursday night.
